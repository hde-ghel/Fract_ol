## Description

Fractol is a project aimed at exploring fractals, mathematical sets that exhibit a repeating pattern displayed at every scale.

## Features

Multiple fractals : Mandelbrot, Julia, BurningShip, Excalibur, Buffalo, and few more implemented by modifying Mandebrot or julia base formula.
Increase and decrease max iteration.
Zoom and unzoom following mouse pointeur.
Different colors mode, including: smooth color gradient, grey scaling gradient, iteration based color.
Moving though the fractal set using wasd key or mouse.
Modifying the complex number of the julia set using my julia mode (j key to enable) resulting in various different fractal shape.


## How to use ?

```
$> make
$> ./fractol mandelbrot
$> ./fractol julia
$> ./fractol burningship
```
